Hi everyone, I'm happy to share a mod who add the possbility for the 
Taru (Heavy lifter helicopter of CSAT) to attach and detach the various Pods he can lift.


Warning !!
The mod is for the alone version of the Taru, not with already the pod attached to him. 
You need to Slingload the pod first before you can have possibilty to attach him ;).

Feel free to ask for some features I can add, or report bugs i don't have catch ;).


Features:
Attach and Detach Pods designed for the Taru.
Pods are :
- Ammo Pod
- Bench Pod
- Cargo Pod
- Fuel Pod
- Medical Pod
- Repair Pod
- Transport Pod

Included files:
XENO_Taru_Pod_Mod.pbo
XENO_Taru_Pod_Mod.pbo.XENO.bisign

Usage:
Go in Pilot in the alone version of the Taru, slingload a Pod and an action will be avalaible in the action menu to Attach or Detach the Pod.
Action available for Copilot or LoadMaster too.

FOR AGM USER !!
Actions to manage your pod are in the self menu of AGM (check the AGM option to see the keys...).

FOR ORDER YOUR AI !!
When you have an AI in the pilot seat, select him with F2 or F3 or etc, and open your AI-action menu (keybinding "6") and you should
see orders availaible.
